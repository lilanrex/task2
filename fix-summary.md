Hi,

After checking the HackathonCard component, here are some of the issues I found and fixed.

What Needed Fixing:

Basically, there were a few awkward spots and potential issues:

Conditional Display:
Location icon/text showed even with no location data.
Date information showed even if start/end dates were missing.
The "View More" / "Show Less" button for descriptions displayed even for short descriptions not needing expansion.


Data Handling & Formatting:
Participants count displayed "undefined" and didn't handle pluralization (0, 1, vs. many).
Description truncation ("...") was applied incorrectly sometimes.
Status text (e.g., "upcoming") wasn't capitalized nicely ("Upcoming").


Button Functionality & Semantics:
"View Details" button was non-functional (no action/link).
"View Details" button lacked the correct type attribute, potentially causing form issues.
Using <button> for "View Details" might be semantically incorrect if it only acts as a link.


Accessibility (a11y):
Main hackathon image lacked descriptive alt text.
Informational icons (location, date, etc.) lacked screen reader labels (aria-label).
"View More" button didn't announce its expanded/collapsed state (aria-expanded).
"View Details" button lacked a clear screen reader label differentiating it from others.


Data Requirements:
Essential props (name, image, dates, status) were not marked as required, risking broken cards.
Styling & Responsiveness:
The card had a fixed width (w-96), preventing proper responsiveness.
Status badge text color wasn't explicitly set, risking poor contrast/readability.


Fixes Implemented:

Data Requirements:     Made essential props (name, imageUrl, startDate, endDate, status) mandatory.
Conditional Display:
Location info now only renders if location data exists.
Date info now only renders if both start and end dates exist.
Participants text now only renders if a count is provided, handling 0, 1, and plural cases correctly.
Description reduced ("...") logic was corrected.
"View More" button now only renders when the description is actually truncated.

Button Functionality:
Correct type attribute set for the "View Details" button.
"View Details" button now executes a passed onViewDetails function or links to hackathonUrl.
"View Details" button is disabled if neither an action nor a URL is provided.

Accessibility (a11y):
Added descriptive alt text to the main image (Banner image for Hackathon Name").
Added aria-label attributes to informational icons.
Added aria-expanded attribute to the "View More" button.
Added a clearer aria-label to the "View Details" button ( View Details for Hackathon Name).
Changed date text color for better contrast.

Styling & Responsiveness:
Removed fixed width, implemented responsive width using max-w-sm w-full.
Set explicit text colors (black/white) for status badges to ensure readability.
Added capitalization for status text display (e.g., "Upcoming").
Added title attribute to the hackathon name for full visibility on hover if truncated.
Updated next/image usage for better practices.


Suggestions:

Improve date handling (use Date objects, formatting libraries like date-fns, show relative time).
Implement loading states (e.g., skeleton loaders) while data is fetching.
Enhance semantic structure by wrapping the card content in an <article> tag.
Use next/link for the "View Details" button if it navigates within the Next.js application.
Extract the status badge into its own reusable component.
Add unit/integration tests to verify card rendering with different data variations.
